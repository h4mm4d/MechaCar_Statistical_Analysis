## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

R Summary Output for Predicted MPG for a sample of 50 cars 


In above summary vehicle length and ground clearance have p-value < 0.05 therefore rejects null hypothesis H0 and spoiler angle, and AWD options are not significant, therefore may not have significant affect on MPG and fails to reject null hypothesis. Vehicle weight is significant at 0.1 confidence interval. Since, mpg varies for many different reasons and confidence level should not be too strict I would recommend that to improve mpg along with ground clearance, and vehicle length, vehicle weight shoul dbe considered as well.  
This is definitly not a zero slope linear model. However, slope of AWd option and spoilet angle are close to zero. 
There is strong evidence that vehicle length and clearnace does affect mpg and somewhat weight as well. Therefore, based on these critara mpg of a prototype could be predited to certain degrees.   


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Lot 1 and Lot 2 with variance on 1 and 7.5 ar emeeting the standard and lot 3 with variance of 170 ponds per square inch does not meet the standard. Therefore lot3 should be rejected. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Over all Mecha_coil and lot 3 are significant enough to reject null hypothesis (H0). Therefore, there is significant issue with lot 3 that is causing whole data to be skewed. Lot 1 and lot 2 fails to reject null hypothesis on its own. Therefore, the variance in quality is statistically insignificant.
