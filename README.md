## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

R Summary Output for Predicted MPG for a sample of 50 cars 

In above summary vehicle length and ground clearance have p-value < 0.05 therefore rejects null hypothesis H0 and spoiler angle, and AWD options are not significant, therefore may not have significant effect on MPG and fails to reject null hypothesis. Vehicle weight is significant at 0.1 confidence interval. Since, mpg varies for many different reasons and confidence level should not be too strict I would recommend that to improve mpg along with ground clearance, and vehicle length, vehicle weight should be considered as well.  
This is definitely not a zero-slope linear model. However, slope of AWD option and spoiler angle are close to zero. 
There is strong evidence that vehicle length and clearance does affect mpg and somewhat weight as well. Therefore, based on these criteria mpg of a prototype could be predicted to certain degrees.   

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Lot 1 and Lot 2 with variance on 1 and 7.5 are meeting the standard and lot 3 with variance of 170 pounds per square inch does not meet the standard. Therefore, lot3 should be rejected. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Overall MechaCar and lot 3 are significant enough to reject null hypothesis (H0). Therefore, there is significant issue with lot 3 that is causing whole data to be skewed. Lot 1 and lot 2 fails to reject null hypothesis on its own. Therefore, the variance in quality is statistically insignificant. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
MechaCar has uphill battle against well-established competitions. It is a new model by a new company. There are few things that can sell cars. 
1. Brand name that MechaCar has yet to establish 
2. Reliability that also will take time to prove
3. Styling and looks, that could be delivered from the beginning 
4. Luxury and comfort could be delivered at production 
5. value for money 
6. Performance. 
8. Fuel economy 
9. Safety 



A good case study for them would be Tesla that is only car company in US that was launched from scratch and was successful. History and reliability have to be built overtime. However, other factors could be quantified and worked on deliver value to the consumer. To make themselves marketable they should offer something the other don't for example:
        1. When Hyundai and Kia launched in US they offered 10 years warranty even when their products were not reliable. 
        2. Tesla offered full electric car with over 200 miles range. 
        3. VW offered four years of free maintenance as their maintenance were expensive. 
I recommend MechaCar to do market research and find out what they can offer that competitions are not offering, for example five years warranty with five-year maintenance to overcome new manufacturer label.
